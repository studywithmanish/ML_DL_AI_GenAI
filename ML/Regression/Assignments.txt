Data Preprocessing:

How do you handle missing values in the dataset?

What scaling or normalization techniques will you apply to the features?

How will you handle outliers and anomalies in the data?

Will you perform any feature engineering, and if so, what kind?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

What is the distribution of the target variable?

How do the features correlate with the target variable?

Are there any multicollinearity issues among the features?

What are the statistical summaries and visualizations of the data?

****************************
Statistical Analysis:

What are the hypotheses for testing normality of the data?

Which tests will you use to check for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)?

How do you detect and handle outliers (e.g., using IQR, Z-scores)?

What are the results of any chi-square tests or other relevant statistical tests?

**************************
Modeling:

Which regression models will you start with (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)?

How will you perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search)?

How do you validate your models (e.g., cross-validation, train-test split)?

What metrics will you use to evaluate the models (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared)?

**********************************
Ensemble and Stacking:

Which ensemble methods will you use (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)?

How will you implement stacking and combine different models?

How will you compare the performance of individual models and the ensemble?

******************************
Model Comparison:

What statistical tests will you use to compare model performances (e.g., paired t-test)?

How will you visualize the comparison (e.g., box plots, residual plots)?
